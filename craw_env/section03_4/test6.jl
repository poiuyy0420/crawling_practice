{"title": "What's the business case for UWB, which Apple supports in iPhones?", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/12/iphone-12-5g-logo-100871567-large.jpg", "contents": "Apple appears to have kick-started development and implementation of the Ultra WideBand standard first deployed in a mass market product in iPhone 11 \u2014 and now available in smartphones from Apple and other manufacturers.This technological deployment is beginning to transform into new business cases, so what do we have so far? tells us interest in the standard is increasing fast. It also details some of the big names to have recently joined the UWB Alliance, a roster which does not at this point include Apple.The standard has numerous advantages and uses, as described in much  and . But first, here's a quick (and light) guide:UWB is a very low-power wireless technology. It transmits data across a wide frequency of bands (from 500MHz up to several gigahertz) at a range of around 100 meters. The use of wide frequency bands means it passes through walls far more reliably than Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.The highly secure standard is good at figuring out proximity, location, and \u2014 because of the frequency it operates on \u2014 it can send out information for use in various deployments through walls at much better rate of success than Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This also makes it useful for short-range data transfer between devices.At present, Apple primarily uses the UWB standard (in the form of its U1 chip) for spatial awareness, so devices equipped with it can find other devices using the same tech. This manifests itself in AirDrop, HomePod mini, and . It is also expected to make some use of the tech in its anticipated Find My  devices, which will (we think) use Bluetooth and UWB to create a framework for finding items such as lost keys and spectacles (so long as they have one of these tags connected to them).While Apple isn\u2019t a UWB Member, it is a member of the \u00a0(CCC), a group including members from across the vehicle manufacturing supply chain interested in using UWB to create systems using smartphones to open, lock, and start cars. Apple uses this for its Car Key system, which lets users open their vehicles as they approach them, rather than requiring the iPhone or Apple Watch to be held close to the lock. By extension, this model extends to a world in which doors open automatically as authorized users get close to them, thanks to UWB.But new business cases are also emerging:The CCC is engaged in a project called Car Data. The idea here is for iOS to build an ecosystem to support data-driven solutions, such as pay how you drive insurance, road monitoring and fleet management. It\u2019s considered to be the successor to the open  standard, used to connect apps between phones and cars. is building out an ecosystem of UWB components for multiple markets, including smart homes. In homes, the company imagines automated home systems that follow owners between rooms, opening and unlocking doors, setting \u2018scenes,\u2019 and performing other tasks. The idea extends to lost item tracking.These ideas are useful in homes, but should also be of use in any automated environment. Offices, hospitals, schools, manufacturing, and distribution centers may all be improved through UWB-based presence and automation tools. The standard is highly accurate, which may enable location based and M2M applications we haven\u2019t yet imagined, particularly as the data informs spatial awareness systems.That might mean smart sensors in mass transit to help you navigate to your route for you (and more, see below), but may also be of use in heavily automated warehousing and distribution systems. UWB is also situationally aware, so it can be of use in collision detection and industrial equipment handling systems.The notion of location, identity, and proximity marries quite well to Apple\u2019s , at least conceptually. App Clips let you access partial features of an app without downloading the entire package. Where available, these are usually provided via App Clip or QR codes or NFC tags, and can also be launched from within apps. You may come across them when renting a scooter or buying a coffee, for example.Such access to cut-down versions of apps seems to lend itself well to UWB, in the sense that you may be presented with the chance to use apps on your device as you travel, shop, or wander through the retail warehouse. There are also AR applications: the proximity awareness inherent to UWB lends itself to indoor mapping tools to guide you round museums, supermarkets, or shopping malls.The \u00a0describes Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) as a tool that will save medical staff time by helping them quickly find patients and equipment, while the radar sensors of the tech may become useful as tools to remotely measure heart rate and respiration without device contact. Such systems are being deployed in smart buildings, as baby monitors, and to help senior citizens live more independently as fall detection systems.Incredible accuracy and precise location detection is pretty important when you lose your keys or spectacles, but it becomes essential for agriculturalists searching for accurate, affordable low-power systems for livestock tracking and smart health monitoring tools.CES saw Taiwanese start-up  demonstrate a device it calls iDistance, designed to help people maintain social distance to help stop the spread of COVID-19. This uses UWB to sense when someone gets too close and will alert the wearer. It can process up to 50 nearby people each second.The company has also developed UWB-based products for overhead drone detection, indoor positioning, and a system that uses UWB to identify a person a robot should follow \u2014 a pram may follow the parent, a warehousing trolley may follow the picker, or a defibrillator may know which nurse it should travel to and on which floor it will find them.Humatics developed a UWB-based navigation system for trains in New York in 2019. The system is basically designed to provide accurate and immediate positioning of trains in tunnels across the transit system. The idea being that the accuracy of the location data generated by the technology means transit management can run more trains more efficiently on the track, which means travellers get to their destination a little faster.While we don\u2019t yet understand Apple\u2019s greater plans for use of the technology across its devices, the fact it continues to introduce UWB chips inside its biggest-selling product (iPhone) shows the company\u2019s dedication to creating an ecosystem in which at least some of the above business propositions can begin to emerge.So, while at present, Apple\u2019s adventures in UWB deployment are a case of \"watch this space,\" the emerging plethora of business-use scenarios that are slowly manifesting themselves seem to describe an enterprise opportunity."}

Password inspections, less annoying site permission requests", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/06/pcw-chrome-primary-100724768-large.jpg", "contents": "Google earlier this week released Chrome 88, adding capabilities to the browser's password manager; streamlining permission requests from sites that asked, say, to switch on the microphone; and for enterprises, ending support for an add-on that called up Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) to render old intranet websites and legacy apps.The Mountain View, Calif. search giant also paid out more than $81,000 in bounties to security researchers who reported some of the 36 vulnerabilities addressed in Chrome 88. One of the bugs was marked \"Critical,\" Google's top-most threat level (and resulted in a $30,000 reward to its finder, researcher Rory McNamara). Nine others were tagged as \"High,\" the second-most-serious ranking. A number of the bounties \u2014 10, including three of those labeled \"High\" \u2014 had not yet been assigned a dollar amount, so Google's final payout will certainly be higher than the acknowledged total.Because Chrome updates in the background, most users can finish a refresh by relaunching the browser. To manually update, select \"About Google Chrome\" from the Help menu under the vertical ellipsis at the upper right; the resulting tab shows that the browser has been updated or displays the download process before presenting a \"Relaunch\" button. People new to Chrome can  for Windows, macOS and Linux directly. The Android and iOS browsers can be found in the Google Play and App Store e-markets, respectively.Google updates Chrome about every six weeks; the previous upgrade was released Nov. 17.Google drew the most attention to changes to Chrome's password manager,  to the improvements. \"As we kick off the New Year, we're excited to announce new updates that will give you even greater control over your passwords,\" said Ali Sarraf, a Chrome product manager, in that post.Chrome, like every other major browser, has long sported a baked-in password manager; Google has used earlier upgrade cycles to brace up that manager, making it equivalent, more or less, to those in rivals Edge (Microsoft) and Firefox (Mozilla).In Chrome 88, the integrated password manager \u2014 reached by clicking the key-like icon after clicking the user account in the upper right \u2014 boasts an in-browser password checker that quickly identifies weak passwords and/or those which probably have been revealed in past data breaches. (This service, dubbed \"Safety Check,\" debuted in May 2020; Google claimed that since then, it's seen a 37% reduction in compromised credentials stored in its browser.)Depending on the result of the check, one or more of the stored-in-Chrome passwords may be labeled \"Change password.\" This is the second improvement in Chrome 88's password infrastructure. \"Starting in Chrome 88, you can manage all of your passwords even faster and easier in Chrome Settings on desktop and iOS (Chrome's Android app will be getting this feature soon, too),\" Sarraf said.Clicking on the \"Change password\" box beside a weak or previously-revealed account will, most of the time though not always, take the user to the pertinent website's log-in screen or even the page for creating a new password.\"The new features with Chrome 88 will be rolled out over the coming weeks,\" noted Sarraf, referring to Google's usual in-stages upgrades, a cautionary approach that prevents the entire user base from being affected by an unexpected bug or even customer blowback.Google seeded Chrome 88 with a new permissions request that the firm called a \"chip\" to differentiate it from the usual pop-up prompt. \"This change will be rolled out gradually throughout Chrome 88,\" Google said in the\u00a0.The chip, a small UI element at the left end of the address bar, is less intrusive than the typical pop-up. (When  enabled the chip, it appeared as a blue oval enclosing the words \"Use your location?\" After a few moments, the oval shrunk to a small blue circle. Clicking on the chip displayed the usual location request pop-up.)\"Since the prompt doesn't intrude in the content area, users who don't want to grant the permission no longer need to actively dismiss the prompt,\" Google said after arguing that many users immediately dismiss such permission requests simply to clear the screen.Users whose copy of Chrome hasn't yet received the chip update will have to type , search for , change the field at the right to \"Enabled\" and relaunch the browser to see the feature.Google disabled all installed copies of the Legacy Browser Support (LBS) add-on with Chrome 88. Now coded into Chrome, LBS was designed so IT admins could deploy Google's browser but still call up IE to render apps or sites that need that browser.LBS \u2014 the extension, not the technology itself \u2014 has been on a road to extinction for some time and accelerated from Chrome 85 on. At this point, even enterprise policies that allowed IT staff to force install the add-on or mandate its continued operation no longer work.Chrome has its work cut out here as even with LBS now part of the browser, it's at a substantial disadvantage to Edge and Microsoft's IE mode. That's largely because Edge and IE mode are tied to Windows 10's  and the latter's myriad configuration options.More information about using LBS with Chrome can be .Elsewhere in the release notes for Chrome 88, Google reminded users that the macOS version of the browser requires OS X 10.11 (aka \"El Capitan\") or later. Chrome will no longer run on Macs powered by 2014's OS X 10.10, better known as Yosemite. This edition of Chrome also is the first to support extensions written in the new Manifest V3 format, which Google has declared will be more secure than the current add-on framework and offer users more granular control over extensions' impact on privacy.The next upgrade, Chrome 89, will be released in six weeks, on March 2.Google this week released Chrome 87, boosting performance with \"the largest gain ... in years\" and featuring a reworked user interface for the browser's built-in PDF viewer.The Mountain View, Calif. company also  to security researchers who reported some of the 33 vulnerabilities addressed in Chrome 87. Ten of the bugs were marked \"High,\" Google's second-most-serious threat level. (Critical vulnerabilities are very unusual in Chrome.) A large number of the bounties \u2014 seven of the 10 tagged High \u2014 had not been yet given a dollar amount, so the actual payout will certainly be significantly higher than the acknowledged amount.Because Chrome updates in the background, most users can finish the refresh by relaunching the browser.

People new to Chrome can  for Windows, macOS and Linux directly. The Android and iOS browsers can be found in the Google Play and App Store e-markets, respectively.Google updates Chrome about every six weeks; the previous upgrade was released Oct. 6.Google rarely trumpets a Chrome release with an accounting of new features and functionality, but it broke with precedent for Chrome 87, which it bragged about in a   another to the .\"This month's update represents the largest gain in Chrome performance in years, thanks to many under-the-hood improvements,\" wrote Matt Waddell, director of product for Chrome, in the Nov. 17 post.According to Waddell, Chrome 87 loads pages up to 7% faster than before, starts up as much as 25% quicker and uses less memory doing so. Other improvements, specifically several related to Chrome's tabs infrastructure, reduce processor usage by as much as five times, extending notebook battery lifespans up to one-and-a-quarter hours.Google has been working on tabs for months, promising performance increases driven by throttling background tabs to a mere fraction of CPU time, then waking those tabs only when they're brought into the foreground. Some Chrome users will see the tab throttling in action (and get the performance improvement) with this version, but Google will continue rolling out the functionality through at least Chrome 88, which is slated for a January 2021 debut.Other tab-related changes will come to the browser, Waddell promised, including a tab-specific search tool accessed from the toolbar. Searches will be conducted not only on the active browser window, but on  Chrome Windows. This will appear in Chrome OS first, \"then to other desktop platforms soon,\" Waddell said.Chrome PDF viewer \u2014 the UI (user interface) which displays these documents and offers some limited manipulation \u2014 has also been enhanced in version 87.Another long-promised change, the improved viewer sports a toolbar that collects previous functions \u2014 such as zooming in and out on the document \u2014 as well as new options, like the current page number and a fit-to-width command, in one place. The new viewer also includes a two-up view \u2014 two pages, shown side by side \u2014 a mode to see added annotations and a sidebar with page thumbnails.Also debuting in Chrome 87, according to Waddell, is a new address bar function dubbed \"Chrome Actions,\" which is a group of text shortcuts that users can type into the bar \u2014 rather than a search string, for instance \u2014 to access a variety of browser commands, features and settings.The , implying that more will be added later, include  to open the browser's password manager (usually reached via the Settings page) and  to translate the current page.As so often is the case, these actions may not be immediately available to most users. \"This update will be progressively rolling out over the coming weeks,\" Google said in the support document of Chrome Actions. \"A wider rollout is planned for a later release,\" the company said elsewhere.Chrome 87 has also been compiled for the Apple-made M1 system-on-a-chip (SoC), the ARM-based silicon that powers the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini. (Other than Apple's own Safari, Chrome is the only browser to run natively on M1 Macs.)Unlike rival Firefox, Chrome can be downloaded from Google's site as a native app, which should run faster than a copy of the browser translated by Rosetta 2 on the newest Macs. To get the native version of Chrome, users must manually download it, choosing the \"Mac with Apple chip\" option. The standard update process will just update the Intel-based version of Chrome, which will need to be translated by Rosetta 2 again. Later, Google will make good and give users with a M1 Mac the native application.\"If you don't download the update directly from our Chrome download page, it will be delivered automatically to your device over the coming weeks,\" a .On the enterprise side, Google warned commercial customers that Microsoft's move to  \"might interfere with your existing setup\" if they were using Legacy Browser Support. (That latter is the baked-into-Chrome functionality that sends links on an administrator-made list to IE for that browser to open.)Google advised IT administrators to disable the IE-to-Edge redirection by setting the Edge policy  to .Also, said Google, Chrome 87 will be the first version able to complete remote commands sent by IT admins via Chrome Browser Cloud Management. That capability, which might be used, say, to remote clearly browsers' caches or delete their cookies, will \"come to the Admin console in the future.\"Chrome 87 will be Google's last browser upgrade for 2020. The next upgrade, version 88, will be released in nine weeks, on Jan. 19, 2021."}
{"title": "Android's consistency crisis", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/01/android-consistency-100874231-large.jpg", "contents": "Back in Android's earliest days \u2014 way, way back in the prehistoric era of 2010 and the years around it \u2014 the platform was a promising but messy piecemeal effort. It was fresh, it was packed with power and potential, and it was absolutely exciting. But it also had virtually no standards surrounding it, and it consequently felt like a mishmosh of conflicting interface styles and design patterns.In those early days, in fact, that was a frequent criticism you'd hear from folks on the Apple side of the fence: Android was . It was . It wasn't, ahem, an  user experience.And you know what? In many ways, they were right. Android had a lot to offer from the get-go and presented some intriguing advantages over Apple's then especially locked-down and tightly controlled approach, but design and interface consistency were certainly not strengths of the platform at that point. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is either delusional or forgetting what, exactly, the experience of using a Gingerbread-era Android device was like. Powerful? Yup \u2014 you'd better believe it. But polished? Yeah \u2014 not so much.That all started to change in 2012, when Google began to emphasize its first formal set of interface and design guidelines for Android \u2014 a style known as Holo. \"Using system themes means developers can take advantage of a user\u2019s existing expectations,\" as Google  at the time. Having platform-wide guidelines, the company went on to explain, would allow developers to \"design an app with a single predictable look and feel.\"And boy, did that make a world of difference. The presence of design guidelines helped bring a consistent look and feel not only to Android itself but also to the apps around it \u2014 which in turn brought a much-needed sense of cohesiveness to the broader platform and made it immeasurably easier, as a user, to know what to expect. Even when you aren't actively thinking about it, knowing that certain functions will always be in certain places and act a certain way allows you to move around your phone naturally and easily, without any ongoing thought or effort. And coming from the Wild West that Android and its apps had been up to that point, having that added sense of unity completely changed what the platform was like to use.And Google wasn't done yet. The unification extended even further with the launch of the  two years later. So much progress! And yet somehow, almost seven years down the road, it feels like we're moving back in the opposite direction.Android today still has a design standard \u2014 an  of that same Material Design concept \u2014 but the that standard was originally created to achieve seems to be slipping away more with every passing\u00a0month. And the experience of using an Android device, I'm sorry to say, is slipping right alongside it.The entire point of having a design standard, as the term suggests, is to establish, y'know, a  \u2014 and the all-important qualities of consistency, cohesiveness, and unity that come with it. And yet, using Android today, you rarely know what to expect when moving from one app or process to the next.Take the system-level sharing menu, for instance \u2014 a key part of the Android experience and one of the operating system's . The sharing menu, if you aren't familiar, is that series of options that comes up when you tap the command to share something from one app to another \u2014 like sharing an article from your browser into an email or sharing an image from Photos into a cloud storage service.When you tap a basic, system-level command like that, you should know exactly what to expect. The subsequent actions should be little more than muscle memory. And yet, despite the fact that Android has a system-level standard \u2014 one that's been improved immensely over the last several  \u2014 the menu that pops up upon pressing a share command in an app is completely unpredictable.The reason why is actually quite simple: Instead of sticking with the standard system interface, lots of apps now opt to create their  sharing menus \u2014 menus that provide the same exact function as the system standard, in many cases, but with a completely different and often arbitrarily reorganized interface. This is true of numerous high-profile third-party apps, such as Pocket and Firefox. And, perhaps most surprising of all, it's true of an ever-expanding number of -made apps \u2014 including Chrome, Google News, Google Maps, Photos, YouTube, and YouTube Music.Here, for illustration, is the actual system sharing menu in Android:It features specific suggested sharing targets on its top row and gives you the ability to create a row of  beneath that, after which you see a scrolling list of every other available share target on your device. Handy, right? Absolutely! But then you go to share something from, say, Firefox \u2014 and instead of getting that standard menu, you get this:In Pocket, it's this:And in Google's own Chrome browser \u2014 the default stock browser app for Android \u2014 you get :Even more vexing, if you want to get to the standard system share menu from that clumsy Chrome alternative, you can \u2014 and you'll frequently need to, since that custom menu includes only a small portion of the available targets on your phone \u2014 but in order to do so, you have to scroll horizontally, all the way to the right of the menu's middle line, and then tap a \"More\" option at its far end. I'm not sure you could make that process much less intuitive or convenient if you tried.Worse yet, that horizontally-scrolling mess is almost becoming a bit of an alternate standard for some of Google's apps. It's vaguely similar to what you see when sharing something from Google News:And also from Photos:YouTube and YouTube Music have their own  alternate standard with  custom share interfaces. Egads?!Now, some of these interfaces have apparent purposes and reasons for existing \u2014 like the one in Photos, which includes app-specific options for sharing images within that service in addition to the usual external destinations. Others, like the ones in YouTube and YouTube Music, seem to serve no discernible purpose other than just being different for the sake of being different. And all of them, regardless of their reason for existing, ultimately accomplish the same thing: creating confusion and inconsistency and making Android meaningfully less polished, cohesive, and pleasant to use.This backwards progress doesn't stop with share menus, either. Move from one Android app to the next \u2014 even within Google's own homemade applications \u2014 and you'll see a dizzying array of styles for basic system elements like the main app menu and the series of settings within it. Sometimes, you tap a three-line menu icon in an app's upper-left corner to find its settings. Other times, you tap a three- menu in an app's upper- corner to find the same thing. And other times, you tap your in the upper-right corner to uncover a hidden menu with settings and other important options.The trouble goes deeper from there: Even within that profile photo menu setup, the style, design, and purpose of the interface varies wildly from one Google app to the next. In Gmail, Docs, and Drive, for instance, it takes on a simple-looking form and holds only commands for switching accounts, since the apps' other settings are accessed via a three-line menu icon.In Maps, the interface is similar but the  are totally different \u2014 with options for switching accounts along with a link to the app's settings and lots of other top-level commands.YouTube, meanwhile, has a similar sort of setup but with a different design \u2014 one that's less of an overlay card and more of a full-screen, separate-area menu.And speaking of menus, after years of  discouraging the use of bottom-bar menus within apps, Google has started using those elements liberally in its own apps and actively  elsewhere as well. The notion of a change in standard is one thing, but the actual result here is a new  of any standard and a mishmosh in what sorts of patterns you encounter, within Google's own apps and beyonds.Again, it leads to inconsistency and unpredictability \u2014 the enemies of effective and efficiency-aiding interface design.Now, let's step back for a minute and ask ourselves: Is all of this making a mountain of a molehill? I can see how some might say that. After all, it's undeniable that by and large, normal, non-tech-nerd users don't consciously think about or notice things like user interface design \u2014 nor should they.But as any professional designer will tell you, it's undeniable that folks  notice, even if implicitly, when certain apps or experiences are more effective\u00a0than others. And that, dear friends, is exactly how it oughta be. Good design be something you actively think about; it should be something that just makes interfaces easy and enjoyable to use. As one oft-quoted maxim puts it: \"Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself.\"What we're seeing now in Android \u2014 from the lack of consistency and standard-adherence with the share menu to the disjointed, varying approaches to menu placement and basic command positioning \u2014 is exactly the opposite of that. Even if you don't explicitly think, \"Hey, this function isn't where I expected it to be!\" or \"Hmm, I've really had to dig around to find that setting I need,\" you  notice that things aren't as intuitive as they could be. You  notice that you're working harder to do the stuff that should be easy to accomplish. And you  notice, on some level, that the  of using the phone isn't quite as smooth and simple as you might expect.Google's dug itself into an unfortunate hole with this, but it isn't too late. All it'd take to change course is a commitment to consistency within its own ranks and then a matching communication to the rest of the ecosystem \u2014 the same way the company did back in 2012, when the Holo standard emerged, and again in 2014, when Material Design arrived and pushed Android toward a newfound level of polish and cohesiveness.As Google design guru and Material Design mastermind Matias Duarte : \"There's nothing worse than the physics of a world being inconsistent, because it means you're constantly learning \u2014 constantly a child and constantly learning because everything is new and a surprise and it's inconsistent, and you can never settle down into being efficient and optimizing.\"Material Design, he went on to say, was \"all in the service of creating a system that's optimized for helping your brain do as little work as possible.\"That simple, foundational strategy is precisely what's been lost over the years. But with a little dedication and a lot of recommitment, good golly, Google can get it back. The only question is if it actually wants to make that happen."}

It now has more than 47,000 customers, including 24 of the 25 most valuable  brands, 70% of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies, all 10 of the largest U.S. banks and every single one of the world\u2019s 10 top universities.You\u2019ll also find Jamf helping to manage Apple deployments in hospitals, schools, government agencies, and more \u2013 and, in part driven by COVID-19, the pace of platform deployment is intensifying.The rush to  early on in the pandemic was all about survival, with enterprises  within very limited available time.

Or, if given the choice, most employees would choose to use Apple, even if they need to use a virtualized Windows-based app for one or two tasks.\u201dSolutions, including Jamf Protect, help enterprise users gain better visibility into security challenges across their organizations.\u201cWith more employees working from home, companies will focus less on building out facilities and more on making the home environment exceptional for workers \u2014 and that starts with the technology they prefer,\u201d Hager said.Managing complex mixes of platforms across remote environments poses different challenges, so I asked Hager what he feels C-suite executives should look for when searching for internal IT support and external tech support partners.\u201cLook for partners that focus on the ecosystems you offer to employees,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cPartners that try to \u2018do it all\u2019 often force organizations to offer a dulled, slow, end-user experience that lags behind the latest capabilities.

But  \u2014 now, trends are something I can get behind. Trends are less about pretending to have some manner of magic crystal ball and more about observing genuine patterns and big-picture shifts over time.And when it comes to Google and the start of 2021, whoo boy, have we got a budding trend worth talking about right now. It's something that gets at the very heart of Google's business, its ambitions, and its plans for connecting with us as customers and users of its various products and services.It's the slow but significant move toward subscriptions as a key part of the Google experience \u2014 the ever-increasing emphasis on getting us, the (mostly) human mammal-people who rely on Android, Gmail, Docs, and the likes to stop thinking of Google as a purely advertising-powered, free-for-the-taking provider and to start thinking of it as a company we at least pay for the value it gives us.In a way, it brings to mind what we've seen play out with that other big tech player that pivoted not so long ago and established itself as a subscription-driven service provider, particularly in the realm of business \u2014 y'know, a little company known as Microsoft \u2014 and also what we've seen  over on the Apple side of this domain.For Google, the shift is drawing far less attention but has the potential to be every bit as transformative \u2014 maybe even more so. And no matter how you use Google apps and services in your own life, it's bound to impact you. In fact, it probably already is.Before we get into the present, we need to step back for a moment to set the stage for what we're seeing now and what we're likely to see more of in the months ahead. After all, Google may have been built as an advertising company at the start \u2014 with free services supported by a profile-driven, personalized ad network \u2014 but it's actually been making  money by selling subscriptions to its services for quite a while now.The first such signs showed up in 2006, when the company launched its awkwardly named  product \u2014 a fully managed, subscription-based collection of its popular productivity apps. The offering would eventually be shortened to Google Apps or sometimes Google Apps for Work, then changed from to G Suite and eventually from to its current brand of Google Workspace (which, full disclosure, I  more often than not). But despite that dizzying and hilariously Google-esque string of rebrandings, the basic idea of the effort has remained the same.And despite the program's success, the Apps/G Suite/Workspace/Whatever You Want to Call It effort has remained a  compared to the Google ad machine. At the same time, questions about the long-term staying power of that advertising business have been growing louder with every passing year \u2014 and it's not too difficult to see why.We've got a few different fronts of evolution happening at the same time, really. First, in general, folks are spending more time using walled-off services and less time searching in traditional ways, which limits the amount of info Google can collect for ad profiling and the number of ads it can serve. Beyond that, people are becoming ever more concerned with privacy and , which, for better or for worse, is somewhat at odds with the core nature of Google's profiling technology. And regulators (which may or may not include ) are growing ever more focused on the nature of Google's advertising business and whether it gives the company too much power.So, yeah: All in all, it adds up to create quite the spicy porridge for a company whose bread and butter depends predominantly on that very advertising business \u2014 a business that accounted for a whopping of Google's revenue in the .And that, my fellow Google observer, brings us to today.Over the past year, Google has positioned itself to move past the near-total reliance on advertising by laying the foundation for a whole new kind of business \u2014 one that's supported by people paying actual money for the stuff they're using instead of getting it entirely for free. In typical Google form, the transition has been happening bit by bit, in a very piecemeal manner, and you really have to step back to see the forest for the trees and realize the broader significance of the shift that's taking shape.Think through it all with me for a sec, though, and you'll quickly get the picture. In 2020 alone, Google:And even isn't everything. In November, Google launched a  that'll soon serve as the foundation for Plex, a \"new mobile-first bank account\" that'll become available later this year and be tightly integrated into the Google Pay experience. That may not be a subscription in the traditional sense, but you'd better believe it's designed to serve a very similar purpose \u2014 to create  between you and Google that'll support the company's business and give it another bit of non-ad-related cushioning.Each one of those pieces may seem relatively small in and of itself, but look at 'em all together, and you start to see the bigger picture they add up to create. Heck, Google itself is even starting to promote some of these subscriptions collectively in a  in the main, top-of-screen menu of its Google Store website.It may not be the full-fledged  I proposed last summer \u2014 with an option to get a new Pixel phone every couple years along with device protection, extra Google storage, and elevated post-sales software support at a price that'd be roughly comparable to what you'd pay for the devices outright over that same period of time \u2014 but goodness gracious, it's getting pretty darn close.For years, people have bemoaned Google's ad-centric approach to apps and services and complained about the fact that, as the saying goes, \"if you're not paying for the product, you the product.\" Well, it sure looks like Google is working toward giving us another option, at least on certain levels. And all signs suggest what we're seeing right now is still only the start."}

However, it will not replace the Mail and Calendar applications baked into Windows 10 until 2022, with the substitution for Win32 Outlook even further out than that.The idea of one app able to run on multiple platforms \u2014 \"write once, run anywhere\" was one once-popular description, that one pitched as an edge for Java \u2014 has a long history in software development in general, and in Microsoft's specifically.Microsoft has taken more than one stab at this, the latest \u2014 before the current one \u2014 when it launched Windows 8 in 2012. Largely driven by a desire to meld mobile and desktop, the concept was branded a whole series of names, from \"Metro\" and \"Modern\" to \"Windows Store\" and \"Universal.\" Apps were to run on both Windows-powered smartphones (then a foundational pillar of Redmond's overall strategy) and Windows 8 devices like PCs and tablets. And when Windows 10 loomed, Microsoft started calling them simply \"Windows\" apps.It was confusing as all get out. And ultimately, all failed to reach the one-for-all app universe goal.Thus a good question should be:  Earlier goes at Windows universal apps have foundered because the results have been sub-standard compared to a native application (in other words, one written specifically for the OS). Although Microsoft will reportedly build in native OS support for some aspects of email \u2014 offline storage and the operating system's own notification system, for instance \u2014 such promises have been made before ... and fallen flat.While the \"write once, run many\" model \u2014 another label for the idea, and ideal, of cross-platform \u2014 is a laudable goal in theory, one that could result in enormous gains in development productivity, perhaps also in application reliability and stability, in practice there are also mundane reasons why this makes sense to Microsoft.By 's reckoning, the most important is that the \"Monarch\" Outlook will be based on web technologies and thus either run in a browser or be, for all intents and purposes, a browser on the inside with an outside wrapper masking that fact.Microsoft has a browser fight on its hands after abandoning its own technologies for Google's Chromium to power Edge. By 2020's end, Edge accounted for about 11% of global browser activity, an increase of 57% over the previous 11 months. (Edge went Chromium in January 2020.) During that stretch, Edge, well, edged past Mozilla's Firefox to take second place behind \u2014 a  way behind \u2014 Chrome. Edge remains Chrome's only legitimate threat.Microsoft will use whatever tools it possesses to push Edge as the browser best suited for businesses, particularly the larger enterprise customers which fuel its bottom line. That includes wiring Edge into business-critical email.(Google has been criticized for building Gmail so that it runs best in Chrome, but it's likely that the pairing helped the latter supersede Microsoft's by-then creaky Internet Explorer (IE) and until this year, keep Edge on, well, the edge of dissolution.)If Microsoft succeeds in making a new cross-platform Outlook out of Edge, it can boast of the browser's prowess to the crowd that matters, businesses small and large. Better yet would be an app that runs  a browser, any browser, but which provides the best performance when run in Edge, not Chrome."}

What is this? Why does it matter? And what might this mean for your enterprise?Given that most Apple users haven\u2019t yet installed Wi-Fi 6 routers in their homes and offices because of the cost of that equipment, news of a follow-up standard may not seem terribly important \u2014particularly after the traumatic year that is the first week of 2021, one of the more benign highlights is that the  has begun .Wi-Fi 6E comes with all the features of Wi-Fi 6 but extends into the 6GHz frequency band. If you keep up with network provision (and I can\u2019t possibly imagine why you wouldn\u2019t on such slow news days as these), then you\u2019ll know that this frequency was \u00a0in some nations (U.S., UK. Europe, Chile, South Korea, UAE).That means traffic in this part of the spectrum is rare, which makes for:The standard offers greater bandwidth and is far more capable of handling the demands of both video streaming and IoT applications. It's already in use in both the  and  sectors.Proponents of the standard claim:Wi-Fi 6E is all of the above, but with the addition of support for the 6GHz spectrum.According to the Wi-Fi Alliance:Wi-Fi 6 is and was an important improvement when Apple began introducing it with iPhone 11.\u00a0It\u2019s now supported by all Apple Silicon Macs, iPads and iPhones \u2014 but its existence means absolutely nothing unless you are on a network that supports it. That means deployment is taking place as .It remains an important supplement to other forms of network access and will inevitably become more available over time.For business users, deployment of Wi-Fi 6E support should already be on the map. As they accelerate connected device deployments, they will need robust bandwidth to support all those systems. That\u2019s precisely what Wi-Fi 6 (and 6E) provide. It\u2019s important to see it as an adjunct to other forms of connectivity, even 5G.There\u2019s some expectation the standard will see rapid adoption. Phil Solis, research director at IDC, anticipates more than 338 million devices that support Wi-Fi 6E will enter the market, and predicts \u201cnearly 20 percent of all Wi-Fi 6 device shipments supporting 6 GHz by 2022.\u201dThere are applications for the development of new consumer and enterprise experiences built to make use of the robust support the standard provides.\u201cThis year, we expect to see new Wi-Fi 6E chipsets from several companies, and a variety of new Wi-Fi 6E smartphones, PCs, and laptops in the first quarter of 2021 followed by TVs and VR product announcements midyear,\u201d Solis said.If you\u2019re in the market for a new router you  that supports Wi-Fi 6E. Doing so will bring you all the benefits of the Wi-Fi 6 alongside support for 6E, setting you up for iPhones and other Apple devices that support either or both. You\u2019ll get better support for IoT deployments, and you\u2019ll be able to doom scroll faster to your heart\u2019s content."}

The year also ended with 55,900 fewer jobs than the US IT industry had on Jan. 1, 2020 \u2014 a drop of 1.5% for the year. (Last week, the\u00a0US Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] revised its figures for 2020, resulting in a revised drop of 55,900 versus the 81,100 reported previously.)A separate survey by the industry association CompTIA, using BLS data, showed that the broad US tech industry  of 391,000 positions (22,000 of which were at tech vendors) in December 2020 \u2014 even as the US as a whole lost 140,000 jobs. About 44% of those tech sector jobs are for positions such as IT staff, software developers, and IT project managers; the rest are support positions such as sales, marketing, and management.Janco\u2019s survey focuses specifically on IT jobs, mainly people in a CIO\u2019s organization, whereas the CompTIA survey looks at the entire tech sector.The December growth in tech and IT jobs still left the broader tech sector below December 2019\u2019s level, with 4.68 million jobs in December 2020, down from 4.73 million a year earlier. CompTIA\u2019s survey shows a steady increase in tech jobs since July 2020, after a steep drop that began in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Janco survey showed that IT middle managers lost the most pay ground in 2020, with an average 0.08% salary reduction at large enterprises and 0.07% reduction at mid-sized enterprises. IT staff saw 0.03% average salary increases in large enterprises and 0.04% in medium enterprises. Executives did the best, of course: their salaries were up 0.59% in large enterprises and up 0.35% in medium ones.April and May were the worst months for US IT jobs in 2020, . In those months, 116,000 IT pros lost their jobs due to COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns. Hiring partially recovered in later months, but the total of 3.58 million US IT jobs in 2020 remained below 2019\u2019s 3.64 million (but slightly above 2018\u2019s 3.54 million).Janco notes that IT consulting and contract positions meant to augment IT staff were all but eliminated in 2020 and hiring growth stalled in the second wave of lockdowns that began in the fall as COVID-19 infections resurged. Those infection rates continue to grow in early 2021; Janco\u2019s interviews with 101 US CIOs reveal that they don\u2019t expect IT job or salary growth in 2021.Still, IT was fortunate in 2020 compared to many other industries.\u00a0The COVID-19 pandemic devastated many industries, eliminating jobs at an unprecedented scale in the travel, hospitality, entertainment, and events businesses. Retailers with physical stores faced massive job losses as well, though manufacturing has largely bounced back. The US overall had  as of June 30 (the latest data available) compared to 2019, the BLS reported. The tech unemployment rate has been roghly half that of the national rate throughout the pandemic, ending at 3% in December 2020 versus 6.7% for the economy as a whole, CompTIA reported.Despite those massive losses in multiple industries, the average US salary rose 2.6% in 2020, according to the , which was last updated on Oct. 12. The latest data from the BLS, which covers the first half of 2020, showed an 8.6% average salary increase from a year earlier. Some of the salary increases reflect higher pay for grocery workers, delivery drivers, and warehouse workers whose jobs became more critical during the lockdowns and who were at greater risk of contracting the virus in their work.Of course, people who lost their jobs aren\u2019t included in salary surveys, so those figures reflect the pay of the still-employed.CompTIA reports that software developers had the largest employment gains (4,700 hires) in December, triple that of the next-largest group, systems analysts (1,400 hires)."}

With many businesses eyeing \u201chybrid\u201d remote-work strategies this year, keeping customers connected via the platform\u2019s video and messaging tools continues to be a priority, according to Ujjwal Singh, head of product at Workplace.With that in mind, Facebook today unveiled updates to its video broadcast capabilities within Live Producer, along with an upgraded Safety Check feature \u2013 now rebranded as Safety Center.SIngh, in an interview, also talked up plans to build on the productivity capabilities within Workplace, which now has around 50 third-party  with various business applications. That number trails rival collaboration tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams. spoke to Signh last week about what Workplace customers should expect in the coming months, with productivity tools and asynchronous communications also on the horizon.\u00a0\u201cLive Video is one of the key standout features for Workplace and one that most of our customers use pretty regularly. One of the main things we've done is add the ability to have multi-hosts. In a world where most of us are remote, when you're trying to do a broadcast, do a town hall, or do a Q&A, there are many times you want to include someone else in that. It could be a guest speaker, it could be someone else within the company that you want to have a discussion with \u2014 for example, the CEO wants to bring in the CFO because they're talking about how the quarter went. An external use case might be a relevant guest speaker that is an expert, such as a local expert on the pandemic.\u201cIt's built very much to be secure. It's still a company product, we don't want the equivalent of random people finding a link on Twitter or wherever else and becoming guest speakers in a CEO call. So, security and making sure that it's still a closed ecosystem [are vital]: not just anybody can join.\u201cWe\u2019ve also added basic analytics. If the CEO goes live, the company wants to know how many people saw it, what did they react to, how long did they watch the video for.\u201d\u201cSafety Center is an evolution of Safety Check, which is something that's used on the consumer side within Facebook but also within Workplace. For example, in 2019, Delta used Safety Check during the hurricane season to make sure staff were safe. We've used it [at Facebook] for the pandemic to share updates like office closures and local restrictions and how to contact for local support \u2014 that kind of thing.\u201cThe specific changes are really around UI. We focused on making Safety Center easier to use, easier to discover, easier to manage the comms before, during, and after an incident.\u201cWe've added different message types as well: travel advisories, safety alerts, different ways to interact with employees and for them to interact back with the company. It is more than just marking themselves as safe; not every incident is just 'are you okay, yeah, great move on.'\u201cIt's to address the different scenarios, not just the earthquake or the hurricane scenarios but more in line with the kinds of scenarios that we all have to deal with today.\u201d\u201cThis is part of our 2021 vision. Today, Workplace is a great place to come and talk about work and learn about work. But in 2021 we also want to make it a place where you can get work done. \u00a0\u201cThe simplest example is DocuSign.  means people do not have to leave Workplace to be able to sign documents, especially if they're collaborative documents that multiple people need to sign off. Our platform enables that without email chains and all of those kinds of things.\u201cThat's a fairly simple utilitarian example; what you're going to see in 2021 is us leaning into examples like that, expanding on [the integration with] ServiceNow [for example], and with some of the other SaaS providers that people use to get work done. We're also going to expand the types of integrations that we do, to make Workplace a place you can actually be productive while being collaborative. One broad way of thinking about it is it's not single-player use cases that we're focused on, its multi-player collaborative productivity that we\u2019re going to lean into, because that\u2019s our strength.\u201d\u201cYes, the analogy I would use is our launch last year of . It [provides] the ability to have the equivalent of a wiki to publish a note that's long-lived; it's doesn't just live on a post. Instead of having to go to a separate tool to do the work there and then paste or post that in, Knowledge Library means you don't need a separate wiki tool, there's a wiki integrated inside of Workplace. That's an example of us doing a native integration, versus just saying, 'Hey, if you're using this external tool, we integrate with that.\u2019\u201cWe think that\u2019s a really good example of what people want to naturally do as part of communicating within larger organizations. So there are other examples like that we're looking at, that will get natively added inside Workplace.\u201d\u201cAnother area that we're focused on in 2021 is leveraging \u2018async\u2019 [asynchronous communications] along with \u2018sync\u2019 communications.\u201cThere's a very real video fatigue in the absence of actually physically being present with each other, so one of the areas that we're going to explore is how to do that in a much more sustainable way. By leveraging async, whether that's with video or audio, it\u2019s that notion of how we make sure we still feel connected without having to be on display in front of a camera.\u201cAsync video is an example of what we think could be useful, but we think there's other areas that are worth exploring around the feeling more connected and feeling like there's presence, that we are we are together without having to stare at each other over a camera.\u201d\u201cOur core mission is to build community at work and help maintain company culture. My view on this is that's easier to do when everyone is in the one same office. As you get to a \u201cmixed mode\u201d world, the notion of making sure everyone is on the same page and informed and feels like they can still have a voice at the company, those are things are just more important.\u201cSome of our biggest customers today \u2014 independent of the pandemic \u2014 use Workplace for exactly those reasons across their split offices, because they have offices in multiple time zones or are spread geographically. We've seen that people are leaning more into our core features in Workplace, things like Live, things like async posting and having discussions, versus everything having to be sync. ...Those are things that we've seen more people use and we think that will continue as more people become are remote.\u201d"}

The phones will almost certainly be the de facto standard bearers of the high-end Android experience for the months ahead, and they're all but certain to be among the top-selling premium Android devices of 2021.In many ways, it's not surprising. When it comes to high-end Android phones, Samsung does a lot of things right \u2014 from its sleek, eye-catching hardware designs to its exceptional build quality and frequently top-of-the-line components. And that's to say nothing of the equally or perhaps even  important no-holds-barred marketing strategy that's helped Samsung gain and maintain its dominant position within the Android ranks.And yet, as someone who closely studies the Android ecosystem and aims to offer advice about the most advisable experiences available within it, I find myself struggling to wholeheartedly recommend Samsung's Android products \u2014 especially for serious business users \u2014 more so with every passing year. And it's not because of any manner of subjective assessment; it's because of some glaring, foundational flaws with the real-world experience Samsung provides on its Android-based Galaxy devices.They're issues that not only impact what it's like to use Samsung's phones over the entire time that you own 'em but also impact the all-important areas of privacy and security as it pertains to your personal and/or company-connected data. And while I'm all too aware that I'm likely to get a fair amount of pushback for focusing on these typically underemphasized areas \u2014 hey, brand loyalty is a powerful thing these days! \u2014 now in particular, this stuff desperately needs to be brought to the forefront.Here, specifically, are four reasons I'd encourage anyone to think twice before committing to a Samsung Android phone.Ads are a mostly unavoidable part of contemporary life, especially when technology is involved. But while Google implements ads into otherwise free online services \u2014 an arrangement that's well publicized and that allows those services to remain free for general use \u2014 Samsung goes a step further and actually puts ads into the heart of its high-cost mobile products. And it does so in a way that's over the top and unacceptably invasive.It's something we've talked about before \u2014 from the ads prominently  to the endless  pushing everything from new Samsung devices to fee-requiring Samsung apps and services \u2014 and it's an issue that only continues to expand and grow ever more troubling over time.Just last week, Samsung reportedly started to  to its U.S. Galaxy devices with the apparent sole purpose of monitoring phone-owners' location, sensing when they're in a store that sells Samsung products, and then using their notifications to push them ads for those items. As I wrote in , it's tacky, it's abusive, and it's obnoxious \u2014 and it makes for an unpleasant and frankly unacceptable user experience, whether we're talking about a $2,000 phone or even a $200 one.And that, unfortunately, is only the start.Here's where the really disconcerting part comes into play: In addition to baking those over-the-top advertising systems into its smartphone experience, Samsung  has mechanisms in place to  \u2014 to double-dip, as I've put it before, and directly profit off the info you assume is protected.We've seen this in the form of a tucked-away setting within the system-level Samsung Pay app that, unless dug up and disabled, allows your financial information to be shared with \"Samsung Pay partners.\" That discovery last year shocked me enough that I decided to comb through Samsung's various , where I found even more unsettling fine print. For instance:And the list just . Another layer built into Samsung's core smartphone software collects the same sorts of sensitive information, as a\u00a0 discloses, bringing in Samsung-made apps like the company's custom Calendar and Internet (browser) utilities to analyze your data from  domains as well \u2014 and then reserves the right to \"collect, analyze, and share\" all of that information in order to provide you with \"advertising and direct marketing communications about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties that are tailored to your interests.\" Just what every IT manager dreams of!Oh, and speaking of ads, that service built into the Phone app that we talked about a minute ago also has  own  \u2014 and one notes that the company behind the effort is able to \"collect search, location, and call log information automatically\" from users' devices and then share such data with its \"affiliates or subsidiaries\" as well as with \"third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions\" on its behalf.And even  is still .Critically, as I've , none of this is even close to what Google does with the advertising associated with its various free services. First and most significantly, Google  or shares it with any third parties, even when said info is used to help determine what ads you see around the web via Google's ad networks. And beyond that, Google's use of data for ad personalization is a well-known, core part of its business \u2014 one that exists to offset the free nature of services such as Search, Maps, and the non-Workspace versions of Gmail, Docs, and Drive.A smartphone, suffice it to say, is not a free service. You're paying good money for the privilege to own such a product, with the expectation of a professional environment that's free from spammy distractions and questionable built-in connections.And yet, here we are.If you've followed my musings for long, you know I'm adamant about the fact that  \u2014 and for more than just the surface-level features and interface refinements. Operating system upgrades consistently provide consequential under-the-hood improvements in areas like performance, privacy, and security, as we've seen with the current  as well as with  before it.And Samsung has made it painfully clear, year after year, that providing those updates to its customers in a timely and reliable manner simply isn't a priority. My data-driven  \u2014 such as the most recent one, in which Samsung got an embarrassing  for its lackluster Android 10 upgrade efforts \u2014 tell you everything you need to know.To Samsung's credit, the company  been getting better at upgrade deliveries over the past couple years \u2014 but when you actually look at the big-picture data, you realize its improvements aren't . In the grand scheme of things, the company is still running close to a hundred days behind schedule, in a best-case scenario, and typically taking even longer when it comes to supporting its previous-gen, just one-year-old top-tier devices.As a company of its size and with its vast array of resources, Samsung certainly  do better. It  get current software into the hands of its highest-paying customers within a matter of days of its release, if it really wanted to. It simply doesn't  to treat that non-revenue-generating form of support as a priority. And for business users in particular, that's an increasingly tough asterisk to justify, especially when commendable near-instant-upgrade options  elsewhere on the platform.Last but not least is the most abstract reason for my Samsung recommendation hesitation, but it's an impossibly important part of the picture. It's the overall user experience \u2014 or what it's actually like to  a device in day-to-day life.As someone who owns both a recent Google Pixel phone and a recent Samsung Galaxy phone, let me tell you: The difference in user experience between those branches of Android is astounding. It's a contrast I've heard reinforced by numerous people who have reached out to me after taking the Galaxy-to-Pixel plunge over the years.One of my favorite analogies, offered up by my friend and fellow tech philosopher , is that using a Samsung phone is kind of like visiting Vegas: You\u2019ve got lots of flashy lights, eye-catching bells and whistles, and things that lure people in off the street and make 'em want to come check it all out. After you've been in that environment for a while, though, you just start to feel just kind of\u2026dirty. It's sensory overload and an awful lot of clutter that actively gets in the way of comfort and efficiency. Going to a Pixel-like setup, in contrast, feels like going back home \u2014 to a place that might be less exciting, on the outside, but that has all the stuff you actually need and an environment that's better suited for long-term habitation.Interface issues aside, Samsung phones are just  with confusingly competing elements and built-in bloatware. You've got things like the prominently featured Galaxy Store, which pings you endlessly and tries to get you to think of it as your primary app marketplace despite the fact that the Play Store is immeasurably more stocked and up to date with current, desirable titles. You've got Samsung's own Contacts app, which syncs with  only by default and thus makes it difficult to access your info on other devices or transfer it to future phones  made by Samsung (a sharp contrast to , which you'd have to know about and actively seek if you wanted to embrace it \u2014 something most average phone-owners wouldn't think to do). And don't even get me started on .In addition to all the bloat, Samsung simultaneously  valuable elements of the core Android operating system for no apparent reason. Galaxy phone owners won't get the incredibly useful (and ) new  that's built into the Android 11 power menu, for instance, nor can they take advantage of Android's  or possibility-packed  for phones. They can't even enjoy the seamless, interruption-free update process Google has offered within Android since 2016, since Samsung somehow still sticks with the\u00a0\u00a0that preceded it.Now, look: If you find yourself enamored with Samsung's approach and see all of this as much ado about nothing, that's perfectly fine! Android is all about choice, after all, and there's certainly nothing wrong with choosing whatever path and manner of product you prefer. But it's time we start talking about this stuff openly and as a prominent part of the Samsung device discussion. That way, anyone facing a purchasing choice can at least arm themselves with all of the facts and make a fully educated decision about what sort of setup makes the most sense for them."}

PC shipments post biggest upswing in a decade", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/01/arrows-showing-upward-trend_growth_chart_graph-100747015-large.jpg", "contents": "The PC market rebounded last year, sporting the highest growth rate in a decade, industry analysts said this week, pinning credit (or blame) on the coronavirus pandemic.Research firm IDC pegged 2020's global shipments of personal computers at 302.6 million devices, a 13% increase over the year prior, which represented the largest annual gain since 2010. The shipment volume was the largest since 2014, said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager with IDC's mobile device trackers team, in an interview.The turnaround was striking: Of the past 10 years, six saw year-over-year declines while one had been flat.Gartner Research, an IDC rival, also claimed a notable boost in PC shipments. Even though Gartner's numbers for 2020 differed from IDC's \u2014 the former firm said last year's increase was just under 5%, less than half IDC's \u2014 it agreed that that growth was the highest measured since 2010.The difference between IDC's and Gartner's total shipments for the year \u2014 302 million and 275 million, respectively \u2014 was largely due to the former counting Chromebooks as personal computers, while the latter did not.\"A lot of volume early in the year was because companies had people working at home,\" said Ubrani, reflecting on the spring months, when businesses worldwide first shuttered, then asked employees to work from home. Enterprises, Ubrani said, purchased large numbers of laptops to equip those suddenly-remote workers, the sales volume at times sufficient to completely throttle the component supply chain.School districts soon added their PC demands to the rising chorus as many tried to equip their students with devices \u2014 low-cost laptops in almost all cases \u2014 so that children could learn remotely. \"School systems were not used to one-for-one,\" Ubrani said, referring to PC-to-student ratios. \"They were used to students sharing laptops.\"A third group \u2014 families with school-aged children \u2014 joined in on the rush-to-PCs, adding machines to the household when school districts did not (or simply could not) step in.\"Beyond the enterprise and educational [markets], there has been a lot of strength in the consumer market,\" said Ubrani, citing not only the desire of families to give each child their own notebook but also an increase in interest in gaming-centric PCs. Hunkered down at home for long stretches of lockdowns and quarantine, families needed entertainment distractions; some solved that by buying not only PC gaming rigs but also spending more on game titles.Consumers also rediscovered PCs in the past nine months, Ubrani said. \"Many of them had gone years since buying a PC,\" he noted, and as at-home orders lengthened \u2014 or returned \u2014 realized their old machines didn't cut it in gaming, crafts or other projects. \"They found they needed a new device.\"The PC industry benefited from the pains suffered by other areas of the economy, Ubrani contended. Some families and individuals had more disposable income available during the pandemic because they weren't spending the usual amounts on travel, say, or dining or out-of-the-house entertainment.In fact, Ubrani expected that consumer PC buying would continue to recover from the past decade, when many \u2014 including some here at  \u2014 were writing off that market as not only moribund but also purposeless in the face of smartphones and tablets. \"I think this shows that there has been a resetting and rethinking of the importance of PCs\" for consumers, Ubrani said.Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple and Acer booked the largest PC shipment numbers for 2020 (and in that order), IDC reported. Gartner's numbers were preliminaries, like IDC's, and ranked the vendors in the same order, albeit with different year-end tallies.Apple easily took honors as the Big 5 vendor with the highest year-over-year growth rate in 2020, posting a 29% gain by IDC's data and a 23% increase in Gartner's estimate. IDC pegged Apple's shipments at 23.1 million for the year; Gartner tapped it as 22.5 million.Chromebooks, the label applied to laptops powered by Google's Chrome browser-based operating system (Chrome OS), also surged in 2020, analysts said.Gartner said that the December 2020 quarter witnessed a 200% year-over-year increase in Chromebook shipments, reaching 11.7 million units. Over the course of the full year, Chromebook shipments grew by more than 80%, totally nearly 30 million.IDC put Chromebook laptop shipments at 19.6 million through the end of the September quarter, or analogous to Gartner's count for the same nine-month stretch. (Numbers were still being tabulated for the December 2020 quarter, Ubrani said.)\"Demand is pushing the PC market forward and all signs indicate this surge still has a way to go,\" said Ryan Reith of IDC, who leads the firm's mobile device trackers group, in a statement. \"In retrospect, the pandemic not only fueled PC market demand but also created opportunities that resulted in a market expansion.\"Ubrani agreed. Although he expects a slight slowdown in shipments to businesses during 2021, consumer shipments are projected to increase through 2024. \"We'll see a lot of demand in 2021 because some of that went unfulfilled [in 2020]. Those orders slipped from the end of 2020 into early 2021,\" Ubrani said."}

Apple now seems to be dealing with this problem, introducing a fix in the latest public beta release.For some strange reason, Big Sur introduced a controversial and potentially insecure change that meant Apple\u2019s own apps could still access the internet even when a user blocked all access from that Mac using a firewall. This wasn\u2019t in tune with Apple\u2019s\u00a0. What made this worse is that when those apps (and there were 56 in all)  access the \u2018Net, user and network traffic monitoring applications were unable to monitor this use.It meant Apple apps could access the Internet to gain Gatekeeper privileges while other applications could not, posing a potential security challenge, as they were included on the .It was subsequently shown that this protection could be subverted to give apps \u2014 including malware \u2014 similar special powers. Rogue applications could be running in the background, bypassing Getekeeper protection, even when the user believed their Mac was protected by a Firewall.This exploit wasn\u2019t especially trivial, and it .If you are running the current public version of Big Sur, you can see the list for yourself at /System/Library/Frameworks/NetworkExtension.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/Info.plist file, just look for \"ContentFilterExclusionList.\"Apple has fixed this problem in its latest public beta, as noted by . The company has removed the ContentFilterExclusionList from macOS 11.2 Big Sur beta 2, which means firewalls and activity filters can now monitor the behavior of Apple\u2019s apps, and also makes for a reduction in the potential attack vulnerability.We know why Apple attempted this. When the company \u00a0(kexts) from Macs, it also built a new architecture to support extensions that relied on kexts.However, it also chose to make its own apps exempt from these frameworks, which is why software that relied on the new extensions architecture couldn\u2019t spot or block the traffic they generated.I can imagine some reasons it might make sense for some Apple applications to be enabled to run in some kind of super-secret mode. Specifically, I\u2019m thinking about  and how useful that might be if left to run surreptitiously on a lost or stolen Mac. But even in that instance, it seems more appropriate (and far more in tune with Apple\u2019s growing stance on privacy and user control) to give users control of that interaction, perhaps with something like a \"run secretly in the background and resist firewalls\" button.In the future, as Apple moves toward mesh-based coverage, particularly for Find My, the challenge engineers will need to solve is how to enable traffic \u2014 finding other Apple devices or sharing information about their location, for example \u2014 to safely and securely be maintained as a discrete background process without generating additional user friction (security messages) and maintaining privacy and security across the chain.I\u2019ve a feeling this may have been an attempt in that direction, but the fact it could be subverted to penetrate Mac security is unsustainable. I\u2019m sure Apple will be seeking better solutions to such conundra.The current edition of Big Sur hasn\u2019t yet deployed this fix, but the fact that it is now available within the latest public beta suggests it will ship more widely in the next couple of weeks.When it arrives, it also introduces another useful layer of protection for , which will no longer be able to side load potentially unapproved iOS apps as the capacity to bypass the firewall will have been removed."}

There is also the problem that false positives may add to the pressure already being felt by health providers worldwide while fostering a false sense of certainty. After all, we\u2019re all pretty  when it comes to coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, so tests that are accurate are hugely important.However, as an adjunct to existing testing and tracking tools, it seems plausible to imagine smart device manufacturers will take this research and expedite development of monitoring tools based on their tech. If they do so, they will need to explain this data may not be completely accurate and should be used in conjunction with other tests.This should be useful to all of us, particularly to employers of mission critical on-site staff, as those few days of advance warning could help reduce overall infection: Staffers who receive an alert of potential infection can be supported to stay home and get tested, helping limit the possibility of infecting other essential workers.Advance warning of potential infection is incredibly valuable, particularly given so many are both asymptomatic and the length of time the virus sits before infection becomes obvious.Of course, used in conjunction with the built-in COVID-19 trackers , these wearables could help reduce the spread of the virus and save lives.Given the regulatory obstacles to developing such a solution fast, it may be useful to recognize how Apple Watch can already help maintain heart health using the new  tool introduced with watchOS 7.2 and iOS 14.3 iPhones.The tool provides useful insight into how healthy your heart is by measuring your maximum oxygen consumption levels. To enable the feature:(If you\u2019re anything like me, you may see an alarming decline in overall fitness over the holiday season, compounded by lockdown where I am \u00a0\u2013 and this particular Health data reading makes that decline quite obvious.)The use of wearables to monitor, warn and guide people into establishing better self care models is implicit to Apple\u2019s plans around the watch.\u00a0\u201cMost of the money in healthcare goes to the cases that weren\u2019t identified early enough,\u201d Apple CEO\u00a0. \u201cIt will take some time, but things that we are doing now \u2014 that I\u2019m not going to talk about today \u2014 those give me a lot of cause for hope.\u201dStay safe.Please follow me on"}

Not only did Microsoft make a point to tell users that it was stripping Google's services from Chromium and replacing them with its own homegrown alternatives, but it could recreate those services it did not already have much easier than smaller browser makers.Several browsers are, like Edge, founded on Chromium and may have attracted the ire of Google, among them Brave, Opera, Epic and Vivaldi.It was unclear what prompted Google to throw the API book at its small fry rivals, which collectively don't account for more than a rounding error on Chrome's current more-than-dominant share. That others can build browsers atop Chromium was always part of the deal, what with Google's original decision to take the open-source route for the project.Hijacking Google's own services, though, was likely a borrowing too far."}
