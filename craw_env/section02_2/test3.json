{"contents": "But, first let's see why would you even need proxies. When you start extracting data from the web on a small scale you might not need proxies to make successful requests and get the data. But, as you scale your project because you need to extract more records or more frequently, you will experience issues. Or the site you're trying to reach might display different content depending on the region. So these are the two cases when you need to start using a proxy solution. proxies are much easier to get access to and they are much cheaper. In many use cases, where you cannot extract data without any proxy, you can just start using data center proxies and be able to extract data.Residential proxies are harder to get access to and they are more expensive, because they are provided by actual Internet Service Providers and not data centers. Residential proxies are also higher quality and can work even when data center proxies fail.Whether you should use data center or residential proxies in your web data extraction project, it comes down to your situation\u2019s details. There\u2019s no general rule of thumb to decide which type of proxy will work for you. But one thing is for sure: unless you have some special requirements you should start off with data center proxies. Then, based on how it works for you, you can switch to residential proxies if you really need to.Residential proxies are more expensive, thus you will probably be better off using data center proxies, if you can, and applying some techniques to keep your proxy pool clean."},
{"contents": "Price Intelligence is leveraging web data to make better pricing, marketing, and business decisions. Basically, it is all about making use of the available data to optimize your pricing strategy, making it more competitive, increasing profitability, and ultimately, improving your business performance.From competitor monitoring to dynamic pricing and MAP monitoring, web extracted pricing data has endless uses. Brands and e-commerce companies use pricing data to monitor an overall view of the market. Dynamic pricing can be used to make automatic pricing decisions based on competitor\u2019s data combined with internal data so that you always remain profitable. MAP or Minimum Advertising Price monitoring is a technique that uses web extracted data to ensure the resellers and partners are maintaining the pricing according to the company policies.During our webinar on \u201c\u201d in June 2020, we got a lot of questions related to the processes and challenges of pricing data extraction. We cover a few important questions here:A: It varies from website to website, but the general idea is to find the pages where such promotion codes are available and build the logic of looking up code and applying it (clicking a button or sending AJAX request) into your extraction code."},

{"contents": "Imagine a long crawling process, like extracting data from a website for a whole month. We can start it and leave it running until we get the results. Though, we can agree that a whole month is plenty of time for something to go wrong. The target website can go down for a few minutes/hours, there can be some sort of power outage in your crawling server or even some other internet connection issues.Any of those are real case scenarios and can happen at any given moment, bringing risk to your data extraction pipeline. In this case, if something like that happens, you may need to restart your crawling process and wait even longer to get access to that precious data. But, you don\u2019t need to panic, this is where (HCF) comes to our rescue.HCF is an API to store request data and is available through Scrapy Cloud projects. It is a bit similar to , but its intended use is to store request data, not a generic key value storage like Collections. At this moment, if you are familiar with "},

{"contents": "Article extraction is the process of extracting data fields from an article page and putting it into a machine-readable structured format like JSON. In many use cases, the article page that you want to extract is a news page but it can be any other type of article. Based on our experience in the web data extraction industry for over 10 years, the demand for structured article data is getting higher. There is more information available on the internet than ever. But still, having access to structured news data and being able to consume relevant and timely information can set you apart and give you a competitive edge. This is what article extraction can do for you.In order to extract article data from the web, you need an extraction tool. It can be a challenge to find the tool that is best suited to meet your needs and provides the functionality and data quality that you expect. In this article, we discuss the most used tools for article extraction that you can choose from.We\u2019re going to look at both open source and commercial solutions. Hopefully, by the end of this blog post, you will have a better understanding of the available article extraction tools and you will be able to make an educated decision whether an open-source or closed-source tool is the best for you to extract news and/or articles.Before looking at the tools, let\u2019s have a quick overview of what is included in article extraction and why you would extract articles.An article\u2019s most important data field and many times the reason you want to extract the data is the "},

From developing better pricing strategies to identifying hidden risks and building better products, web data extraction provides the power to transform infinite web data into a structured format that can help you make profitable decisions.However, as the number of websites continues to grow, data extraction has become increasingly complex. Constantly changing website structures, antibot practices and scaling requirements add to the difficulty.To overcome the ever-increasing challenges, the web data extraction industry has gone through impressive innovations and transformations in recent years that enable extracting accurate data in an efficient manner.

When you scrape this many websites using a single spider, analyzing and validating the extracted data can be challenging.

In this example, we are interested in finding specific keywords on the sites - if the keyword is found on a page then it should be flagged for further analysis.A large subset of heterogeneous sites should be processed to collect information for a specific keyword. We are going to crawl recursively starting from the domain and check all found links on the landing page. Several types of limits can be introduced here, like:The goal is to get as many pages as possible and verify the existence of keywords in them.The first step is inspired by two popular topics in programming:"},
{"contents": "From inconsistent website layouts that break our extraction logic to badly written HTML, web scraping comes with its share of difficulties. Over the last few years, the single most important challenge in web scraping has been to actually get to the data - and not get blocked. This is due to the antibots or the underlying technologies that websites use to protect their data. Proxies are a major component in any scalable web scraping infrastructure. However, not many people understand the technicalities of the different types of proxies and how to make the best use of proxies to get the data they want, with the least possible blocks.Oftentimes the\u00a0emphasis is on proxies to get around antibots. But the logic of the scraper is important too. "}
